# SortVisualizer
* python/pygame application
* Implements bubble, selection and insertion sorting algorithms.
* For each algorithm, the application sorts the bars based on height and colors each bar corresponding to the steps taken by that algorithm.
* This is a great tool for learning how each of these sorting algorithms works, step-by-step.
